			'value' => '<p>Â </p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve been reading awful books lately, and I had this horrible premonition about this book. I was haunted since the cover is pretty and had an interesting premise. I was almost sure it was going to be a complete disaster.<br /><br />Â </p>\n<p>But, heck, no. It was a surprise. Forget the cover and the premise, the book hooked me up and I was desperate to read more and know more.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Cheerleader Isobel Lanley is horrified when she is paired with Varen Nethers for an English project, which is dueâ€”so unfairâ€”on the day of the rival game. Cold and aloof, sardonic and sharp-tongued, Varen makes it clear heâ€™d rather not have anything to do with her either.Â </em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em>But when Isobel discovers strange writing in his journal, she canâ€™t help but give this enigmatic boy with the piercing eyes another look.Â  Soon, Isobel finds herself making excuses to be with Varen. Steadily pulled away from her friends and her possessive boyfriend, Isobel ventures deeper and deeper into the dream world Varen has created through the pages of his notebook, a realm where the terrifying stories of Edgar Allan Poe come to life.Â </em></strong><br /><br /><strong><em>As her world begins to unravel around her, Isobel discovers that dreams, like words, hold more power than she ever imagined, and that theÂ most frightening realities are those of the mind. Now she must find a way to reach Varen before he is consumed by the shadows of his own nightmares.Â  His life depends on it</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Â <br />This summary was taken from <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7129598-nevermore\">Goodreads</a>.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>How did I get interested in this book? I was reading recommendations while I was browsing through the iTunes store. I read two five star reviews about he originality of the story and the big fuzz about including some works of Edgar Allan Poe. I thought it was promising. But I\'m not gonna lie, I just know Edgar Allan Poe just by name since English is not my native language.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>I canâ€™t judge the complexity of the language since, heck, English is not my native language but it was decent to me. Similes or excessive use of commas are not a problem like some other books. Maybe the descriptions were too elaborated. But I was fine with the writing overall.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>The plot started with a clichÃ© situation with two students paired involuntarily to do an English project. And guess what? The two characters fall for each other. But things got better from there since the relationship seemed plausible and realistic. They didnâ€™t fall for each other right away and that kept things interesting. I like when the relationships are built and not forced into: <em>I was in love and I knew we belonged together forever and I will pop out his kids, whatever</em>. Ok, once in a while is fine (not the pop out kids of course xD). But I was getting bitter, frustrated and tired of always reading the same story about how inexplicable two characters are drawn to each other. This story was the exception.Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Isobel was an okay character and at least she was brave enough to leave her friends rather than watch them doing something she thought was wrong. Their best friends are the typical popular bullies and you wonder how Isobel could pair with them in the first place. Varen Nethers was an enjoyable character; even with his gothic personality he had his own sense of humor. I felt so childish wondering: when he is going to appear again? But donâ€™t take me seriously since I thought him being the younger version of Severus Snape from Harry Potter and I fancy anything that smells like Severus Snape.<br /><br />Â </p>\n<p>His interactions with Isobel kept me craving for more and when they finally kiss I was like: Me gusta!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v256/alexandra86/11946681.jpg\" alt=\"11946681.jpg\" />Â </p>\n<p><br />Sometimes he is too cryptic and I was wondering what was going on with him really. But I felt frustrated a few times when he was talking to Isobel and suddenly they had to say goodbye and the conversation was cut off at odd times.</p>\n<p><br />I also enjoyed the family dynamic between Isobel and the Lanleys. At least the adults were there worried for her and not just painted and always out. But sure I found the reaction of Isobelâ€™s father a little bit too exaggerated regarding to Varen in the house.</p>\n<p><br />Brad, the boyfriend of Isobel seemed like a walking stereotype of this jerk popular teenager. One of the characters I enjoyed was Gwen, she was crazy and her introduction seemed a little bit rushed but I enjoyed her interaction with the other characters.</p>\n<p><br />One of the problems I had with the ending it was that Isobel committed the sin of trusting the wrong person even she had the suspicion she shouldnâ€™t trust that person. I felt cheated because of that! She could have been smarter; I know she can be smarter if she wants. And I canâ€™t forget how she was supposed to use the power she had and she didnâ€™t touch until the very end because she didnâ€™t have any other option.</p>\n<p><br /><br />Please Isobel, be more proactive next time! When you are a proactive driver, you can avoid collisions and save lives. When you are a proactive character you can save us from being annoyed and do some good to the world and avoid becoming the typical female doormat character or worse! the typical kitty swiffer character like this one:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v256/alexandra86/kitty-swiffer.gif\" alt=\"kitty-swiffer.gif\" /><br />Gif taken from <a href=\"http://awesomegifs.com/2011/10/kitty-swiffer/\">AwesomeGifs</a></p>\n<p>I can say that I enjoyed the reading very much. I suffered and I was at work sneaking into reading the book when my boss wasnâ€™t watching me. It reminded me of two things: when I used to read Harry Potter when I was a teenager and when I read Twilight in College (I liked both series, deal with it!). But I almost cried when I knew that the second book is due to August 2012.</p>\n<p><br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys YA literature and has hopes to find something better than the average crap that is published. I am craving for the next book and know about what will happen to Varen and Isobel.Â <br /><br /><br />Â pd. I have to comment on the cover, I swear that I thought the girl in the cover looked like Kelly Clakrson to me. Some scenes I just imagined Kelly Clakrson being Isobel, it was funny and cute. And yes, no more remarks on how beautiful the cover was. I give two peanuts about the book cover of any book. For example the new edition of the book The Darkangel by Meredith Ann Pierce has a horrible cover but the story is flawless.Â <br /><br /><br />Â Here my Isobel:Â <br /><br /><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v256/alexandra86/kelly-clarkson-photo.jpg\" alt=\"kelly-clarkson-photo.jpg\" /><br /><br />Picture taken from <a href=\"http://www.singinglikepro.com/celebrity-singing/kelly-clarksons-rock-and-soul-singing-voice\">SingLikeaPro<br /></a></p>'

For a winter challenge in GoodReads a picked up the book â€œOther words for Loveâ€ by Lorraine Zago Rosenthal. I donâ€™t remember exactly why I picked it up from the vast selection of books, but I donâ€™t regret it. Iâ€™m getting used to the fantasy paranormal theme but this book settled in the year I was born (1986) and in New York City with a realistic theme about struggling with life in general.</p>\n<p><br />We have the story of Ari and her teenage years, her relationship with her family, friends and love. It was like a journal and the story starts just the summer before she starts in a Private Academy in New York after inheriting some money from an uncle.</p>\n<p><br />What I liked most from the beginning was the pace, it was not to fast but it didnâ€™t drag too long. And the story felt real, like something that could happen to you or a friend. I could relate to the protagonist, Ari, because she had flaws and insecurities but also had talents, depth and feelings. She was a good girl, with good intentions and I found some of the things that happened to her were unfair but at the same time she learnt from those things (sometimes in the hard way).</p>\n<p><br />I loved the fact that all the characters changed from the beginning to end. They evolved and acted like real persons, which is rare to me in a Young Adult book. And I was very satisfied with how the story ends. For once I was: â€œYes girl! Thatâ€™s how you do in real life. You go!â€</p>\n<p><br />I will recommend this book to my younger sister when she turns 17 or 18. The book makes reference to drug use, alcohol and the sex is there, not like graphic but itâ€™s there and explained so no, I wonâ€™t recommend this to a 12-year-old kid. It was tasteful, Iâ€™m happy with it.</p>\n<p><br />The relationship between the characters reminded of my own life, always changing, some characters coming, then going to then reappear. The interactions were coherent. Arie has a sort of non-religious Catholic family with two caring parents and an older sister, which is married after getting pregnant in High School.</p>\n<p><br />I could see the contrast between present time and the eighties, the lack of cellphones and even the description of the clothes. I even was surprised to find a Venezuelan secondary character in the story (Iâ€™m from Venezuela).</p>\n<p><br />I would say that my favorite character is Ariadne, Ari. She tried her best to satisfy her family and friends, she was strong and also had dreams. She wanted to get to the Art School and she is involved with works related to arts too. She is interesting enough and I never felt like putting down the book because I was tired of the story. She is a relatable character without being selfish and a shallow Mary Sue. Ari is what a female character should be!</p>\n<p><br />Her best friend Summer is in the new Private School. She meets also Leigh who will introduce her to Del and Blake, her two cousins. And of course, they are rich and powerful.Â  Ari falls in love for the first time, and she grown ups with the obstacles and in the end we have this strong girl, independent, inspired and full of life. The end was like a fresh breath of air and not the typical: â€œMy boyfriend is a jerk, but love conquers all so we have our happy ending and we live happily ever after.â€ No, it was realistic end full of hope and self-confidence.Â </p>'

But he also has a dark secret. He is actually Eona, a sixteen-year-old girl who has been living a dangerous lie for the chance to become a Dragon-eye, the human link to an energy dragon\'s power. It is forbidden for females to practice the Dragon Magic and, if discovered, Eon faces a terrible death. After a dazzling sword ceremony, Eon\'s affinity with the twelve dragons catapults him into the treacherous world of the Imperial court, where he makes a powerful enemy, Lord Ido. As tension builds and Eon\'s desperate lie comes to light, readers won\'t be able to stop turning the pages.â€</strong></p>\n<p>Summary taken from <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2986865-eon\">Goodreads.</a></p>\n<p><br />Eon: The Last Dragoneye. Another pick from my reading club. The story was promising because, dragons are involved and I love dragons. The book left me with a good impression and eager to read the second book. How can I describe this book? Itâ€™s sort of Mulan meets Dragons. And itâ€™s inspired in the Chinese/Japanese culture according to Goodman.</p>\n<p><br />Eon is a 12-year-old candidate to become a Dragoneye Apprentice, he is crippled but he has the ability to see the Dragons. The Dragons are some kind of magical or natural forces that the ordinary people cannot see. Heâ€™s studying to become a Dragoneye, which is a person that can channel the power of the Dragon to help in the society. Dragoneyes give their vital power force to the Dragon in exchange for powers.</p>\n<p><br />The Kingdom of the Celestial Dragons is also a place where women are oppressed and excluded from becoming a Dragoneye and the big surprise is that Eon is really a 16-year-old girl, Eona, and she has to pretend to be a boy in order to not be punished and become an Dragoneye and help her master to save the Council from Lord Ido.</p>\n<p><br />I found exciting that the Dragons are based on the Chinese Zodiac. And I liked the description of the Kingdom and the culture. Goodman created her own new world with detail.Â I enjoyed Eon/Eonaâ€™s jouney from a weak crippled candidate to the strong Dragoneye powerful fearless and confident. She has her doubts, and she usually thinks she is not worthy of such challenge. But over the time she finds that the way to succeed in her mission is actually be herself.</p>\n<p><br />I donâ€™t know why, but I could tell what was going to happen at certain times, I guessed right. But everything made sense. Sometimes I wished Eon would have trusted her master and tell her friends to help her but also I can understand she was scared, she didnâ€™t want to disappoint them and solve the riddles by herself.</p>\n<p><br />As a villain Lord Ido is evil and wicked. His appearance awakened fear and he was ruthless and didnâ€™t mind do anything as long he had his way. He wanted power and he was corrupted by it. Also I like they included Lady Dela as a transgender character, it was something fresh to me and she was likeable from the beginning. Ryko was another nice company, brave and strong.</p>\n<p><br />I found the drug use in the story a very nice example on why drugs are bad for you and how drugs can transform you into an ugly villain. I give this book a solid 4 star, the characters were enjoyable, the plot was filled with details and the end was sad but full of hope. I canâ€™t wait to read the second book and see how this story finalizes.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670062278/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=windmullerc0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0670062278\"><br /><br /><br /></a></p>'

			'value' => '<p><strong>Note:</strong> this is a guest post by my husband <a href=\"http://joaquin.windmuller.ca/\" title=\"\">JoaquÃ­n Windmuller</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today I finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Colins.</p>\n\n<p>One of the first issues I had with the books is that it is narrated in first person present tense. A mode that I wasn\'t used to and felt awkward every time I resumed reading.</p>\n\n<p>The awkward sensation continued throughout well into the second book. But eventually it grows on you, or the story traps you in a way that, verbs don\'t matter anymore.</p>\n\n<h2>Book One: The Hunger Games</h2>\n\n<p>Collins is a master of keeping descriptions to the bare minimum so that the reader fills in the voids with imagination (as it should be). But no information is skipped when it comes to letting you understanding the world of Katniss Everdeen, although the discovery is gradual which makes it easy to follow.</p>\n\n<p>The Hunger Games occur on an indefinite time of humanity where technology is highly developed but kept from most of the population.</p>\n\n<p>The 12 Districts that encompass this world are under the tyrannical rule of the Capitol and survive everyday with the bare minimum. This setup is the result of a long gone uprising against the Capitol by the, then, 13 Districts.</p>\n\n<p>Even the privileged that live in the Capitol have access to the technology for only one thing: their enjoyment.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoyment in the form of food, parties and The Games.</p>\n\n<p>The Games are a yearly event that casts two kids from each district into an arena where they have to kill or be killed. All for the enjoyment of the people in the Capitol and as a reminder to the District of who is in charge.</p>\n\n<p>Of course our heroine ends inside this games, and her partner in war is no other than Peeta Mellark. A kid that saved her and her family\'s life during times of extreme hunger.</p>\n\n<p>And this theme is carried throughout the whole series: Katniss\' struggle between being forced to hurt people she owes or loves for the sake of some rules imposed on her.</p>\n\n<p>The other big struggle of this book is the unexpected role Katniss takes on because of her actions. The inspiration for a new uprising of the Districts.</p>\n\n<p>Her unintended act of rebellion saves her and Peeta from the Games but puts all of her loved ones in danger from the Capitol, and its wrath is represented by President Snow\'s calculated threats.</p>\n\n<h2>Book Two: Catching Fire</h2>\n\n<p><span class=\"aside\">\n  <img src=\"http://mary.windmuller.ca/files/4f4712f9-0040-4e0b-bf6d-77ce45498bc9/catching_fire_cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></span></p>\n\n<p>After surviving the Hunger games and having forced the Capitol\'s hand into letting Peeta live too. Katniss is forced into pretending to love Peeta too quell the uprising starting in the Districts. </p>\n\n<p>This book brings to the front row the complexities of Katniss. How she struggles to clear up her feelings for her old friend Gale Hawthorne, her constant issues with trust and her overall awkwardness in human relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Surrounded by the constant threat of the Capitol she embarks into the victory tour through all the Districts tasked to convince the people and specially President Snow that her act of defiance was merely an act of desperate love.</p>\n\n<p>But during the tour all her attempts at honoring the fallen or to ease their pain is seen as furthering the defiance to the Capitol.</p>\n\n<p>The theme of the brutality of a tyrannical government is treated in a gritty manner and the reader really experiences the confusion, desperation and incapacitation of being out of control of one\'s life.</p>\n\n<p>And when you think it is almost over and nothing can be worse, Katniss and Peeta are forced back into the arena because of the special conditions imposed by the Quarter Quell.</p>\n\n<p>This book plays hardball when it comes to gut wrenching experiences, and Suzane Collins is an expert on surprising you with the next turn of events.</p>\n\n<h2>Book Three: Mockinjay</h2>\n\n<p><span class=\"aside\">\n  <img src=\"http://mary.windmuller.ca/files/4f4712f9-0040-4e0b-bf6d-77ce45498bc9/mockingjay_cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></span></p>\n\n<p>You would think that the last book of the series is the one Collins left to explain to the reader how all the suffering in the previous two will make sense and things get better.</p>\n\n<p>But none of that happens. Only the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>Collins makes you feel the incapacitating feeling of being used by enemies and friendlies, the desolation of losing your home, the desperation of broken friendships and the paralyzing experience of seeing family die.</p>\n\n<p>You\'d think that beating the bad guys would result in celebration, but not when so much is lost.</p>\n\n<p>All that is what Suzanne accomplishes with this book.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"clear\" /><h2>Closing Remarks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"pull\">\n  \"May The odds Be Ever In Your Favor\"\n</p>\n\n<p>The Hunger Games is a great novel. There\'s no denying that.</p>\n\n<p>The message it brings is about the horrors of war. It is about how years after the war is over those who suffered still never feel safe.</p>\n\n<p>The whole saga highlights how useless they are and how frustrating it is that everyone knows that yet wars are still allowed to happen.</p>\n\n<p>This main message is entwined with a scarring love story of adolescents that are forced to grow up and behave like adults without the complete toolset that experience brings.</p>\n'

Instead I\'ve been reading stuff related to University and my studies. Yes! I\'m studying right now. The reason for something like this can be summarized in the following: My other bachelor degree never got me a decent paying job or a job that I liked and where I live people don\'t care about my degree anyways, so what to do? Study something else instead. Follow your heart and your dreams they say.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I\'m finishing my first semester of engineering. It\'s kind of weird because classmates are almost ten years younger than me (makes me laugh). And the funniest thing is that with my 26 years old my team members for a project thought I was 18 or 19. Let\'s see if mother nature would bless me making me look young when I graduate and I\'m 30.</p>\n'

I donâ€™t believe in YA paranormal books with Angels, they always end up being a mess and they always turn into horrible surprises.</p>\n\n<p>But for the past three days I received a surprise; fortunately it was a good surprise: I read Angelfall by Susan Ee. I bought this book a couple of months ago since one of my friends with excellent taste in books (I like to call her my guru) liked this book (my other friends, I donâ€™t trust them anymore). And after finishing a challenge for a Reading Club I decided to pick up my Kindle and start Angelfall.</p>\n\n<p>I was in the train on my way to work, it usually take me one hour but as soon as I started to read I got so immersed in the book that I didnâ€™t notice the hour pass by. For making my long commute so pleasant, Iâ€™m thankful Susan!</p>\n\n<p>The story is post-apocalyptic world condemned to doom brought by angels. Our protagonist is Penryn, a teenager girl who has a schizophrenic mother and a crippled sister. Her main goal is survival in a hostile world where there are no laws but chaos, death and sickness. Whatâ€™s not to love about this story? From the first page you are wondering what is going to happen next and how Penryn is going to deal and survive.</p>\n\n<p>The civilized world is long lost. Six weeks ago the mayhem started on Earth, with angels destroying and killing millions and millions. The food is scarce, the gangs have taken the streets and the desperation can be felt everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Things get a tragic turn when Penryn, her sister Paige and her mother witness a fight between five angels against one giant powerful angel. When the evil angels notice Penryn she tries to deviate their attention back to the angel they were about to kill by throwing him back his sword. The result is the big angel fights until heâ€™s able to neutralize his attackers but the evil angels take Penrynâ€™s little sister with them flying away.</p>\n\n<p>Now without her mother, her sister kidnapped and a bleeding angel without wings Penryn decides to do everything she can to rescue her little sister. And thatâ€™s how things are set into motion. The angel, Raffe, and Penryn end up making a strategic alliance to survive. We get to know Raffe, the strong angel without wings and Penryn, the fearless human girl that has determination to accomplish her goal.</p>\n\n<p>What I liked about this book it was the plot. A good twist, a nice surprise and the romance is not cheesy at all. Actually, the romance is secondary in this story and Penryn is not your average Mary Sue protagonist who relies on her paranormal boyfriend to move around. She is strong and her motivation always keeps her going. She is a fighter. Raffe is the injured angel who has to ally with Penryn to get back his wings and repay his debt with her for saving his life. He is a good sidekick, since he is strong, a soldier and has knowledge of the angels. Both characters rely on each other at tough times, escaping, moving around, fighting and surviving for their own reasons.</p>\n\n<p>I loved, really loved the story. I donâ€™t want to spoil the end, or tell what happens next or who is really Raffe. But I would recommend this book to anyone since itâ€™s a very well written book and on to of that very entertaining. The end is clear and doesnâ€™t use the cheap and lazy cliffhanger that we have become used to have nowadays with books and tv series. This book has a sequel, but also can work as a stand-alone. We are left wondering so many things, I have unresolved questions but in a good way. This book makes me want to know more about this Universe, but has a resolution.</p>\n\n<p>The only problem is that I crave the next book. I need it in my life. Please, shut up and take my money. I want to know, I want to read and I donâ€™t want to return to the other books knowing there are good stories like this. I feel sorry for the book Iâ€™m going to read next because probably will be shadowed by how good this was. Thanks Susan! </p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING. Now, please! Leave if you donâ€™t want to be spoiled.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>SPOILER and a silly comment:</strong> Iâ€™m Catholic and Iâ€™m familiar with Angels, the Bible, God and all that stuff. I just remembered Raphael is one of the archangels along with Michael and Gabriel in my religion. Iâ€™m traumatized for life knowing that Raphael, all angelic in old paintings is actually Raffe, he wonâ€™t never be the same to me. I might go to church now with brand new eyes when I see Raphael in a statue or a painting. LOL. Certainly it will be just too weird to see girls inside a church fangirling over Raphael. I know how silly I sound, but I canâ€™t help it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v256/alexandra86/250px-Saint_Raphael.jpg\" alt=\"Raphael\" title=\"Saint Raphael the Archangel by BartolomÃ© Esteban Murillo\" /></p>\n\n<p>This image taken from the Wikipedia shows a painting by BartolomÃ© Esteban Murillo in where we can see Saint Raphael the Archangel. And yeah, totally Raffe!</p>\n'
